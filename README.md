# Airbnb-website
 Airbnb-inspired web application developed using Node.js, Express.js, EJS, and MongoDB. It is the part of a web development course I did. It allows users to search for accommodations, list properties and review the properties. there is no booking functionality implimented yet. Features Search Functionality: Users can search for accommodations based on various criteria such as location, dates, and amenities. Category-Based Listing: Accommodations are categorized for easy browsing and filtering. User Authentication: Secure user authentication system ensures that only registered users can access certain features like listing properties and booking accommodations. CRUD Operations: MongoDB and Mongoose are used for efficient CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations via API endpoints. Server-Side Validation: Joi library is integrated for server-side validation to ensure data schema. Server-Side Rendering: EJS is used for rendering the page server-side and sending it to the user. Image Storage: Cloudinary API is utilized for image storage, allowing users to upload images of their properties. Responsive Design: The application is fully responsive, and well suited for mobile view too.
